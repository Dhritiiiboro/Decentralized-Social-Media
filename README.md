# 🌐 DecentralizedSocialMedia - Web3 Social Platform

## 📖 Project Description

DecentralizedSocialMedia is a blockchain-based social media platform built on Ethereum that revolutionizes content creation and engagement through tokenized incentives. The platform combines the familiar social media experience with Web3 economics, allowing users to earn native tokens (SOCIAL) for creating content, receiving likes, and engaging with the community.

Unlike traditional social media platforms where value is extracted by centralized entities, this decentralized approach ensures that content creators and active community members are directly rewarded for their contributions. The smart contract manages all interactions transparently on the blockchain, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring fair distribution of rewards.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Our vision is to create a **creator-first, community-owned social media ecosystem** where:

- **Content creators are fairly compensated** for their contributions through transparent, automated token rewards
- **Users own their data and content** without relying on centralized platforms that can change policies arbitrarily
- **Community engagement is incentivized** through token mechanics that reward meaningful interactions
- **Censorship resistance** is built into the platform's core architecture
- **Global accessibility** is ensured, allowing anyone with internet access to participate in the digital economy

We envision a future where social media platforms serve their users rather than exploit them, where creativity is rewarded, and where communities can self-govern their digital spaces.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 **Content Creation & Rewards**
- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts (up to 280 characters) and automatically earn 10 SOCIAL tokens
- **Instant Rewards**: Token rewards are distributed immediately upon post creation
- **Content Ownership**: All content is stored immutably on the blockchain

### 👍 **Engagement Incentives**
- **Like System**: Users can like posts from other creators (cannot like their own posts)
- **Like Rewards**: Post authors earn 1 SOCIAL token for each like received
- **Anti-Spam**: Built-in mechanisms prevent users from liking the same post multiple times

### 💰 **Direct Monetization**
- **User Tipping**: Direct peer-to-peer token transfers to support favorite creators
- **No Platform Fees**: Tips go directly to creators without intermediary fees
- **Flexible Amounts**: Users can tip any amount of SOCIAL tokens they own

### 🔍 **Content Discovery**
- **Post Retrieval**: Fetch individual posts with all metadata (likes, timestamp, rewards)
- **User Profiles**: View all posts created by specific users
- **Engagement Tracking**: See like counts and interaction history

### 🛡️ **Security & Trust**
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Advanced security measures prevent common smart contract attacks
- **Access Controls**: Owner-only functions for contract management
- **Transparent Operations**: All transactions and rewards are publicly verifiable
